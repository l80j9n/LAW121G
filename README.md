LAW121G Essay
Semester 2, 2024
Essay Topic
“In the New Zealand legal system, it is the executive branch of government that wields all the power, not parliament, the courts or ordinary New Zealand citizens.”
Write a 1000-word essay explaining the extent to which you agree or disagree with this statement. Make sure that you set out a clear argument and provide reasons to support your view.
Please note: there is no right or wrong answer to this question. Many people have different views on this issue. The task is for you to work out what you think and why.
In your essay, you must draw on the lectures and reading materials from the first four weeks of   LAW 121G to support your argument.    You may also refer to the two recommended textbooks should you wish to (available on short loan from the law library).    You may not refer to any other sources outside the course.
